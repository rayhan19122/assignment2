## 🚀 Features & Learnings

In this assignment, I focused on:
* **Custom GridView:** Implementing a `GridView.builder` with a custom `childAspectRatio` for a clean look.
* **Reusable Widgets:** Created modular `Course` and `Info` widgets to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
* **Data Models:** Practised using dynamic data maps to populate the UI (Batch numbers, seats left, and days remaining).
* **Modern UI:** Added rounded corners, subtle borders, and a custom "See Details" button with an icon to match modern design standards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Language:** Dart
* **Widgets:** StatelessWidget, GridView, ClipRRect, GestureDetector

## 🏁 How to Run

2. Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.
